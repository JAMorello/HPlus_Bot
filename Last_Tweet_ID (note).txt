# In Heroku, this file has a very limited use. It was intended to be used as a starting point in each iteration of
# the retweet function, as the ID it contains is renewed at the end of each iteration (is written the iD of the last
# tweet retweeted). This is done this way to avoid going all the way through a lot of tweets in an user timeline
# (from x to y; ej: from a tweet of 1st March all the way to the last one in 31st of March). So, the file should change
# in each iteration and this should be indefinitely.
#
# But changes made directly to the filesystem on Heroku dynos will be lost whenever the dyno restarts.
# This happens frequently: Dynos are also restarted (cycled) at least once per day to help maintain the health of
# applications running on Heroku. Any changes to the local filesystem will be deleted. The cycling happens once every 24
# hours (plus up to 216 random  minutes, to prevent every dyno for an application from restarting at the same time).
# So, the way Heroku works makes the work the file is supposed to do very limited as the content of the file is restored
# to the original ID. (Check out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42194043/can-heroku-edit-files)
#
# To avoid in some way going all the way through a lot of tweets in an user timeline (as it was intended originally),
# once in a while is needed a manual overwriting of the file and push to heroku master.

# TODO: Implement a database to avoid the deletion of changed files when the dyno restart.
